webstatus
=========

PHP-application where you can list websites/IPs to see if a chosen port is up or down. Handy for hosts managing multiple sites, or to simply check the status of your own website, ftp, ssh and so on.

You'll be able to list the following information:
- Website/service name
- Address
- Port
- Response time
- Total response time

The application is also optimized for mobile phones through responsiveness.
